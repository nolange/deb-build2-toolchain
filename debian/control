Package: build2
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: build2 C++ Build Toolchain
 build2 is an open source (MIT), cross-platform toolchain for building and packaging
 C++ code. It includes the build system (build2), package manager (bpkg), and
 repository web interface (brep). There is also cppget.org, a public repository of open
 source C++ packages.
 .
 The aim of the project is a next-generation build system and package manager for the
 C++ language that provide a consistent, out of the box interface across
 platforms/compilers. Having a sane build file syntax would be nice, too. The toolchain is
 written in C++14 and while not strictly C++-specific, that's the primary focus.
 .
 This package contains the build2 build system
