Description: build2 C++ Build Toolchain
 build2 is an open source (MIT), cross-platform toolchain for building and
 packaging C++ code. It includes the build system (build2),
 package manager (bpkg), and repository web interface (brep).
 There is also cppget.org, a public repository of open source C++ packages.
 .
 The aim of the project is a next-generation build system and package manager
 for the C++ language that provide a consistent, out of the box interface
 across platforms/compilers.
 Having a sane build file syntax would be nice, too. The toolchain is written
 in C++14 and while not strictly C++-specific, that's the primary focus.
 .
 This package contains the build2 build system.
